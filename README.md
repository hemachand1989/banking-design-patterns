## 📚 Key Takeaways for Interview

- **Know when NOT to use patterns** - Over-engineering is worse than under-engineering
- **Understand trade-offs** - Every pattern has costs
- **Real-world context** - Banking examples show you understand production systems
- **Thread safety** - Critical in financial systems
- **Idempotency** - Essential for transaction processing
- **Audit trails** - Command pattern is perfect for this

## ⚠️ Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Using Singleton everywhere** - It's rarely the right choice
2. **Over-decorating** - Keep decorator chains manageable
3. **Forgetting thread safety** - Especially in Singleton and Observer
4. **Not handling exceptions** - Always consider failure scenarios
5. **Ignoring async/await** - Modern C# is async-first

## 🎯 Staff Engineer Level Expectations

- Explain **why** patterns are used, not just how
- Discuss **scalability** and **performance** implications
- Consider **distributed systems** scenarios
- Think about **monitoring** and **observability**
- Understand **trade-offs** and when to break patterns

Good luck with your interview! 🚀
